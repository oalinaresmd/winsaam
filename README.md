Introduction
============
WinSAAM is freely available (http://www.winsaam.org). WinSAAM is a quality windows-based simulation, analysis, and modeling software package that supports building models and fitting them to data [1]. It is geared towards clinicians and researchers who analyze pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and clinical pharmacokinetic data. WinSAAM is well suited for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics because comparmental models are the backbone of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) [2, 3, 4, 5], and WinSAAM is specialized for compartmental modeling.

WinSAAM is a direct descendent of SAAM and CONSAM; the original Simulation, Analysis, and Modeling software packages first developed at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland by Dr. Mones Berman and his team [6, 7]. Over the years, Boston and coworkers at the National Institutes of Health incrementally developed SAAM into CONSAM [8], SAAMII [9], and lastly WinSAAM [10, 11, 1].

The codes assume readers have a basic understanding of fitting a model to data [12]. No knowledge of WinSAAM is assumed. Readers
who need a PKPD refresher can consult Gibaldi & Perrier [13], Rescigno [14], Tozer & Rowland [15], Riviere [16] and Bonate [17].
Readers who want more in-depth knowlege of WinSAAM can refer to references [1], [10], and [11].
